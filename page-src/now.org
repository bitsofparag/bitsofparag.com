* Current Focus
I am mostly working on re-skilling myself for the new job market that is with generative AI tools. Besides tech, I am climbing and belaying with my friend Pablo once a week, with the goal of climbing some small to medium rock-faces outdoors. I am making some small woodworking projects. I am trying to log 15-20km every week running on Strava - not easy but the summer sun is just too enticing to not be outside.

* Projects
- Drafting my next blog post about setting up generative AI models like Llama on your local machine.
- I will be aiming to finish a couple of woodworking projects soon - a box-shaped coffee table and a small oakwood pencil-case.

* Books
- I have started reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51077.The_Last_Song_of_Dusk]["The Last Song of Dusk"]].
- I keep delving into the pages of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DXhVJs5f33&rank=1][The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself]] by Sean Carroll, one of my favorite physicists and a notable science communicator.

* Current Mantra
- /Share your current mantra, quote or guiding principle here./

* Music
- Having watched the final(?) chapter of John Wick, I have been playing its OST quite often, which include songs like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYzwZY2JK04][Marie Douceur, Marie Col√®re]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cm7MEONP48][Think by Kaleida]].
