This is a [[https://nownownow.com/about][Now page]], inspired by [[https://sivers.org/now][Derek Sivers]].
A living document capturing what I’m focused on right now—the kind of updates I’d share when friends ask, *"What have you been up to?"*

* Achievements
- +Co-founded+ Shutdown [[https://web.archive.org/web/20241225011406/https://heypermit.com/][heyPermit]] with my dear colleague Cristian. We pitched our idea at [[https://web.archive.org/web/20240225025316/https://kiez.ai/bridge-to-market/][Kiez]] (now [[https://www.ai-nation.de/][AI Nation]]) and [[https://www.tu.berlin/entrepreneurship/startup-support/tu-startups/container-profile/startups-2024-heypermit][were selected]] for their six-month validation program.
- Conceptualized and developed  [[https://app.changepath.ai/de/register?utm_source=bitsofparag.com&utm_medium=referral][ChangePath's app]] from the ground up. I'm quite proud of the tech stack I selected for this project, not to mention that it also marked the fastest launch time of my professional career.
- Participated in a few hackathons this year. Secured the third prize for an idea to detect inflammatory biomarkers in elderly people.

- Exploring some ideas in cybersecurity and biosciences domains.
- Learning [[https://ziglang.org/][Zig]] for fun and perspective. [[https://go.dev/][Golang]] remains my tool of choice for getting things done.

* Books
- Currently reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30010.The_Complete_Stories_Vol_1]["The Complete Stories, Vol. 1"]] by *Isaac Asimov*.
- Regularly revisiting [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DXhVJs5f33&rank=1][The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself]] by *Sean Carroll*, one of my favorite physicists and science communicators.
