This is a [[https://nownownow.com/about][Now page]], an idea by [[https://sivers.org/now][Derek Sivers]]. A living document on what my life looks like now - things I would say when friends ask, "What have you been up to?"

* Current Focus
- With generative AI tools flooding the tech industry, I am upskilling myself in LLMs. Learning the fundamentals of any technology is important, so I feel [[https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html][this]] is a good place to start for someone already familiar with ML application programming.
- Learning about biodiversity conservation and the critical role it plays in climate action.

* Books
- Started reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/197566578]["Broken Money"]] by Lyn Alden.
- I regularly delve into the pages of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DXhVJs5f33&rank=1][The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself]]  by Sean Carroll, one of my favorite physicists and a notable science communicator.
