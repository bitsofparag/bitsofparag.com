This is a [[https://nownownow.com/about][Now page]], inspired by [[https://sivers.org/now][Derek Sivers]].
A living document capturing what I’m focused on right now—the kind of updates I’d share when friends ask, *"What have you been up to?"*

* Achievements
- Co-founded [[https://web.archive.org/web/20241225011406/https://heypermit.com/][heyPermit]] with my dear colleague Cristian. We pitched our idea at [[https://kiez.ai/bridge-to-market/][Kiez]] and [[https://www.tu.berlin/entrepreneurship/startup-support/tu-startups/container-profile/startups-2024-heypermit][were selected]] for their six-month validation program.

* Current Focus
- From biodiversity conservation to green-energy transition, my year-long entrepreneurial journey with [[https://web.archive.org/web/20241225011406/https://heypermit.com/][heyPermit]] has been deeply fulfilling (and still continuing).
  Taking a short break now and documenting the experience through a series of posts.
- I’ve weathered the *AI revolution* — a decade ago, I faced a similar wave with the explosion of JavaScript frameworks (for those who struggled, [[https://survivejs.com/][SurviveJS]] was a lifesaver). Keeping a close eye on the *generative AI* space.
- Open to *part-time gigs*, especially in *AI and deeptech*.
- Learning [[https://ziglang.org/][Zig]] to keep my programming skills sharp. Still using [[https://go.dev/][Golang]] as my go-to language for over a year now.

* Books
- Currently reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30010.The_Complete_Stories_Vol_1]["The Complete Stories, Vol. 1"]] by *Isaac Asimov* — keeping the AI flame alive.
- Regularly revisiting [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DXhVJs5f33&rank=1][The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself]] by *Sean Carroll*, one of my favorite physicists and science communicators.
