This is a [[https://nownownow.com/about][Now page]], inspired by [[https://sivers.org/now][Derek Sivers]].
A living document capturing what I’m focused on right now—the kind of updates I’d share when friends ask, *"What have you been up to?"*

* Achievements
- Co-founded [[https://web.archive.org/web/20241225011406/https://heypermit.com/][heyPermit]] with my dear colleague Cristian. We pitched our idea at [[https://kiez.ai/bridge-to-market/][Kiez]] and [[https://www.tu.berlin/entrepreneurship/startup-support/tu-startups/container-profile/startups-2024-heypermit][were selected]] for their six-month validation program.

* Current Focus
- Actively leading engineering efforts in two exciting domains:
  - As Director of Software Engineering at a biomanufacturing startup, building a digital system to navigate through the complex landscape of bioinformatics research & datasets.
  - As CTO at a career development startup, architecting and building a "career coach" to support GenZ and Millenials stuck in a quarter-life crisis.
- Wrapping up a year-and-a-half long entrepreneurial journey in biodiversity and green energy with [[https://web.archive.org/web/20241225011406/https://heypermit.com/][heyPermit]]. Taking time to reflect and write about the experience.
- +I’ve weathered the *AI revolution*+ I will admit, this AI wave keeps giving! I have weathered previous tech shifts, but the pace and potential here feels scary and exciting at the same time. Keeping a builder's mindset, and experimenting selectively.
- Learning [[https://ziglang.org/][Zig]] for fun and perspective. [[https://go.dev/][Golang]] remains my tool of choice for getting things done.

* Books
- Currently reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30010.The_Complete_Stories_Vol_1]["The Complete Stories, Vol. 1"]] by *Isaac Asimov* — keeping the AI flame alive.
- Regularly revisiting [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DXhVJs5f33&rank=1][The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself]] by *Sean Carroll*, one of my favorite physicists and science communicators.
