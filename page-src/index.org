  I was the chief architect of a standardized software platform for IoT projects, with focus on data-collection, backend and frontend. This platform was deployed for some of the IoT startups I worked with. For a high-level overview, check out [[https://youtu.be/rUfUZ4bfhWk][this video]] made by my colleague.

  I have often guided and mentored interns as well as [[https://medium.com/@nextbigthingag/nbt-codeunversity-project-partnership-a298a46cf695][student engineers]] in software development, especially with Reactjs and Python.

- {{{collapse_title(8, Rowers on Blockchain)}}}
  @@html:<div class="collapse-panel">@@
  This was a fun project where we connected a gym rowing machine to a vending machine via blockchain to enable a token-based game system. When users complete one of three time-trials on the rowing machine, it rewards them with crypto tokens that they can then use to purchase items from a vending machine. It was my first tryst with [[https://geth.ethereum.org/][Geth]] and [[https://www.modbustools.com/modbus.html][MODBUS protocol]]. Read more about it
