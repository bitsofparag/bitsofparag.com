  @@html:<div class="collapse-panel">@@
  This was a fun project where we connected a gym rowing machine to a vending machine via
  blockchain to enable a token-based game system. When users complete one of three time-trials on
  the rowing machine, it rewards them with crypto tokens that they can then use to purchase items
  from a vending machine. It was my first tryst with [[https://geth.ethereum.org/][Geth]] and [[https://www.modbustools.com/modbus.html][MODBUS protocol]]. Read more about it
