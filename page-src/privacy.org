Bitsofparag is my personal blog. I have no need for your private information or forwarding it to third parties.

* Personal data

In accordance with EU GDPR, [[https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/][personal data]] is not collected. However, in the commenting system (provided by [[https://isso-comments.de/][Isso]]), for a good user-experience in discussions, I request a commenter's name and/or website URL during submission of their comment. But the requests are optional and the commenter can submit their comments anonymously.

* Web analytics

I run a basic Cloudflare-provided analytics to check number of requests and unique visitors. See more details of this service [[https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/account-and-zone-analytics/zone-analytics/][here]]. This form of analytics does not use cookies and data such as IP-address and User-Agent are not logged anywhere.

* Hosting

This website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, please see their privacy policy for what information they collect.

* Links to Other Sites

The site may contain a couple of links to other sites (the badges, for example). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. So, please review the Privacy Policy of these websites if you are concerned.
