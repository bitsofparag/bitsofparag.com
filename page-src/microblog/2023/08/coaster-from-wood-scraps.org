So, I had a bunch of scrap wood from my previous projects (see bottom left in photo) and I didn't want it end up in the waste bin. After a bit of searching, I found [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YKmY0XIIdUw][this Youtube short]] about making a pear-shaped wooden coaster. Then after a couple of hours of templating, band-sawing and sanding, the result is what you see above. I finished it with mahogany-colored wood-stain and coated it with beeswax. Quite pleasing to look at and smells heavenly. The coaster was snatched away by my sister - it has found a happy home.
