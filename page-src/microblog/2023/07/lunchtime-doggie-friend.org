While refreshing myself over a cup of coffee and the dazzling drops of the fountain, I met this adorable Australian Shepherd dog who was being walked by a gentleman. I am keen to have a dog in the future. So, out of curiosity, I enquired about the breed. Turns out the gentleman merely walks his colleague's dog every afternoon. "And you can certainly meet him again, I'm here everyday on a work week", said the kind gentleman as he bid farewell with this gorgeous animal in tow.
