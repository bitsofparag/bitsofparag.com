So, *I turned 40* recently. Feels like a big life milestone has been crossed. There's so much to reminisce over - like how I went from posting silly profile pictures of me on the internet to more stoic ones - that I would need to start writing an autobiography.

For the sake of brevity, I would share that today I feel like a kite, tied on one end to the inevitability of life but free on the other, soaring high, letting go, reaching for the clouds and I choose when to come down. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all who made me feel this way thus far üôè
